🚀 The Ultimate BMI Calculator Showdown! Pounds vs. Kilograms 🤖

👋 Hey fellow coders and data enthusiasts! Ever pondered the cosmic question – "How do pounds and kilograms affect our superhero potential?" 🦸‍♂️💪 Wonder no more, for I present to you the most epic showdown in data history - the Battle of the BMI!

📊 In the red corner, we have "BMI in Pounds," where I summoned the powers of pounds and inches to unveil your mystical Body Mass Index. Turns out, I'm "normal weight," which means I'm basically a donut's best friend 🍩.

🧙‍♂️ But hold onto your code hats, because in the blue corner, it's "BMI in Kilograms" – where I harnessed the magic of kilograms and meters. And lo and behold, I'm "of normal weight" yet again, proving that whether it's pounds or kilograms, data bends to my will (or at least my tape measure).

🎩 Join me in this grand data adventure, where we decipher the secrets of BMI and discover that, regardless of our preferred unit of measurement, we're all the heroes of our own data stories. No scales were harmed in this epic journey, but many funny looks were exchanged! 🤭
